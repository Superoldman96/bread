BREAD is an 'injectable' real-mode x86 debugger that can debug arbitrary real-mode code (on real HW) from another PC via serial cable.

## Introduction
BREAD emerged from many failed attempts to reverse engineer legacy BIOS. Given that the vast majority -- if not all -- BIOS analysis is done statically using disassemblers, understanding the BIOS becomes extremely difficult, since there's no way to know the value of registers or memory in a given piece of code.

Despite this, BREAD can also debug arbitrary code in real-mode, such as bootable code or DOS programs too.
